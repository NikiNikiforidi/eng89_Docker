### What is Docker

- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
-  Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
- Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.

### Docker vs. VM

- Docker
	- In Docker, the containers running share the host OS kernel.

- Virtual Machines
	- VMs are made up of user space plus kernel space of an operating system.
	- Each VM has Operating system & apps. It shares hardware resource from the host
- Docker vs. VMs
	- Under a VM environment, each workload needs a complete OS. But with a container environment, multiple workloads can run with 1 OS
	- VMs are a better choice for running apps that require all of the operating system’s resources and functionality when you need to run multiple applications on servers, or have a wide variety of operating systems to manage.
	- Containers are a better choice when your biggest priority is maximizing the number of applications running on a minimal number of servers.

### Benefits of using docker
- Simplicity and Faster Configurations
	- Users can take their own configuration, put it into code, and deploy it without any problems.
- Rapid Deployment
	 - Docker manages to reduce deployment to seconds. This is due to the fact that it creates a container for every process and does not boot an OS.
- Continuous Deployment and Testing
	- You can use the same container from development to production making sure there are no discrepancies or manual intervention.

- Multi-Cloud Platforms
	- All major cloud computing providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Platform (GCP), have embraced Docker’s availability and added individual support.

### Who is using docker
- 2/3 of companies that try using Docker, adopt it.
- Adopters multiply their containers by five. Docker adopters approximately quintuple the average number of running containers they have in production between their first and tenth month of usage.
- Companoes such as JPMorgan, ThoughtWorksING, Paypal, ADP, Spotify and more
